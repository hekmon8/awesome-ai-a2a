## Introduction

The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol is an open standard initiated by Google designed to enable seamless communication and interoperability between AI agents. Released in April 2025, it provides a standardized method for agents to discover each other's capabilities, negotiate interactions, and coordinate tasks across different frameworks and vendors. A2A is designed to complement other protocols like Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), acting as a higher-level abstraction specifically for agent-to-agent communication.
